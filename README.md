# German credit dataset project

# Predicting credit risk & deploying model using Streamlit #

## By: Noel K. ##

### Statement of Purpose ###

The aim of the project is to predict whether a person is a good or bad credit risk based on their attributes (features). Different machine learning models were explored to compare their performance. 
The models include CatBoost Classifier, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis,  and Gradient Boosting Classifier.

Also one machine learning model(CatBoost) was deployed using Streamlit. This is a demonstration of a simple application that a non-technical person or data science expert can use to input customer's attributes and tell whether the person is likely to pay back a loan or not (good credit risk vs bad credit risk)

### Dataset ###
The UCI German credit dataset was used in this project - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/statlog/german/german.data

### Tools ###

- **Pandas** for importing and processing the data so it can be modelled by a machine learning classifier

- **CatBoost** for training the data and predicting the labels

- **Streamlit** for creating a frontend application
