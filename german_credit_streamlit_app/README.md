# Credit risk App using Streamlit #

## By: Noel K. ##

### Statement of Purpose ###

In this project, a machine learning model for predicting credit risk is deployed using Streamlit. This is a demonstration of a simple application that a non-technical person or data science expert can use to input customer's attributes and tell whether the person is likely to pay back a loan or not (good credit risk vs bad credit risk)

### Data Description ###

The UCI German credit dataset was used in this project - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/statlog/german/german.data

### Tools ###

- **Pandas** for importing and processing the data so it can be modelled by a machine learning classifier

- **CatBoost** for training the data and predicting the labels

- **Streamlit** for creating a frontend application
